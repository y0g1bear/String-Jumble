Assignment:

The purpose of this challenge is to gain proficiency with 
manipulating lists.

Write and submit a Python program that accepts a string from 
the user and prints it back in three different ways:

* With all letters in reverse.
* With words in reverse order, but letters within each word in 
  the correct order.
* With all words in correct order, but letters reversed within 
  the words.

Output of your program should look like this:

Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy
You entered "There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy". Now jumble it:
ydnah dnif yam uoy taht skcirt ro seuqinhcet wef a era erehT
handy find may you that tricks or techniques few a are There
erehT era a wef seuqinhcet ro skcirt taht uoy yam dnif ydnah
"""

we = input("Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better):")
print("You entered "+ we + ". Now jumble it:")
for i in reversed(we):
    print(i, end = "")
splitwe = we.split()
sentwe = we[::-1]
print()
for x in sentwe:
    print(x, end = "")
